            Capital of Brazil
          </h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 1960 as the capital of Brazil and located in the middle of the country, Brasilia may not have a
            long
            history but the city is like an open-air museum. The capital was planned and developed by iconic architects
            Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa and is filled with fine works by these great figures.

            While the city isn’t the permanent home to any club, Brasilia is proud to have the impressive Mané Garrincha
            Stadium which was recently renovated to host the 2014 and following World Cups.
